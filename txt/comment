<To get you fully set up on your new Windows machine with Git and integrate it into your project development process in Cursor, follow these steps:>

### Step 1: Install Git
1. **Download Git for Windows**:
   - Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/), and download the latest version of Git for Windows.
2. **Install Git**:
   - Open the downloaded `.exe` file and proceed with the installation.
   - During installation, select the default options, but ensure you:
      - Choose to use Git from the Windows Command Prompt and the Git Bash terminal.
      - Configure the line-ending conversions to suit your needs (e.g., "Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings").
      - Enable the Git Credential Manager if prompted to help with repository login in the future.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open **Git Bash** or **Command Prompt**, and run:
     ```bash
     git --version
     ```
   - You should see the installed Git version.

### Step 2: Configure Git
Set up your Git user information for commits:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

### Step 3: Set Up a Repository for Your Project
1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory** in Cursor:
   - Open your project in Cursor or navigate to its folder location.
2. **Initialize Git in Your Project Directory**:
   - Open Git Bash in the project directory, or use the terminal in Cursor if it has Git integration:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```
   - This will initialize a new Git repository in the project folder.
3. **Add Your Project to GitHub** (optional but recommended):
   - Create a new repository on GitHub, without initializing a README, license, or `.gitignore`.
   - Link your local repository to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
     ```
   - Remove remote repository
     ```bash
     git remote remove [remote repository name]
     ```

### Step 4: Make Your First Commit
1. **Stage Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
2. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
3. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
### Extra Step: Pull Remote Repository
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

### Step 5: Using Git in Cursor
Cursor has Git integration, allowing you to:
- **View file changes**: Track files you’re editing and see what’s staged or unstaged.
- **Stage and commit**: Easily stage files and commit changes from within Cursor’s interface.
- **Push and pull**: Synchronize with GitHub or any remote repository.

**Cursor Tip**: Ensure Cursor has access to Git through the correct path (e.g., C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe on Windows), and configure it in the editor’s settings if needed.

With these steps, you’ll be ready to use Git seamlessly in Cursor on your Windows machine!


<If you want to ignore your local changes and replace everything in the directory with the latest version from the remote repository, you can follow these steps:>

1. **Stash or Discard Local Changes (optional):**
   - If you want to discard all local changes (including untracked files), you can run:
     ```bash
     git reset --hard HEAD
     git clean -fd
     ```
   - This will reset all tracked files to the latest commit and remove untracked files and directories.

2. **Pull the Latest Version from Remote, Overwriting Local Changes:**
   - Use the following command to forcefully fetch the latest version from the remote repository and reset your local branch to match it:
     ```bash
     git fetch origin
     git reset --hard origin/main  # Replace 'main' with your branch name if different
     ```
   - This command discards all local changes and sets your branch to match the latest state of the remote branch.

3. **Alternative: Delete and Re-Clone the Repository (if needed):**
   - If you want a completely fresh clone, delete the local repository folder:
     ```bash
     rm -rf /path/to/your/repo
     ```
   - Then re-clone it:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
     ```
   
Using these steps will ensure your local repository is fully in sync with the remote origin, discarding any local changes.
